Steam screwed my account so I have to upload this here. Check the discord competition channel for a message with more details.

Actually, here is just the whole message quoted:

"

Okay, so this kinda sucks. All of a sudden I'm getting "Steam Support suspects your account may have been accessed by someone else. We are temporarily forcing your profile private as a security precaution.", which means I can't upload the map. It's already dangerously close to the deadline, which means I don't think I'll be able to get it on steam in time. Because the map is basically finished though, I will upload it somewhere else as a fallback, assuming Steam doesn't fix this within the next 2 minutes.

"

I'll upload it to steam as soon as possible.

Also yeah I know that there are some security vulnerabilities on my end if i'm even getting that message. I *thought* I fixed that, but apparently Dteam decided to screw me over an hour before the deadline.
